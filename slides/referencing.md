## Introduction

Today we will cover 

#### Resources for your literature search

The Library and its website is your starting point. 

* The [Mathematics Subject Guide](https://www.mmu.ac.uk/library/search-tools/subject-guides/mathematics) on the library's website
* [finding](https://www.mmu.ac.uk/library/referencing-and-study-support/finding-information) and 
* [evaluating](https://www.mmu.ac.uk/library/referencing-and-study-support/evaluating-information#t-33917-4) information sources


#### Referencing and *Cite Them Right Harvard*

* Key terminology
* Why and what you need to cite and reference
* Presenting citations in your work
* Some tips on using BibLaTeX

## Referencing

### The purpose of referencing 

Two of the main reasons are

* To give due credit to other authors for the use of their ideas.

* To allow your reader to investigate your work further by
	* checking your claimed sources,
	* finding out more about the ideas you refer to.

### Referencing in different subjects/disciplines

* In the Arts and Humanties referencing can be a **big thing**
	- since the study can involve large archives of material,
	- the arguments can depend on lots of historical documents,
	- or depend significantly on different editions/versions of the same works,
	- ...

* In the Sciences
	- referencing is less of an significant issue in itself,
	- just deal with the two basic reasons above.

## Referencing

### Referencing systems

There are many systems for referencing in use. They combine brief **citations** within the text which refer to full **bibliographic** information about the sources which appears in a list of references at the end of the text and/or in footnotes at the bottom of pages containing citations. As mathematics students, there are two main types of system you should be aware of. 

* *Numeric* reference systems are quite common in mathematics and involve a numbered list of references (also sometimes called a **bibliography**) at the end of the text which are **cited** by number in the text.
 	* In widespread use by many books and journals.
	* But numeric citations convey no information and require interrupting flow of reading if any information about author or age of work is required.
	* Reference lists not always sorted alphabetically by author surname.

* *Author Date* reference systems use **citations** consisting of author(s) surname(s) and publication year which refer to full **bibliographic** entries which are listed at the end of the text, sorted alphabetically by the (leading) author's surname.
	* Requires slightly more effort to implement than numeric systems
	* But citations now convey relevant information
	* Reduces need to interrupt flow of reading
	* Reference lists are always sorted alphabetically

## What the systems look like

In this article Terence Tao (2007) considers what good mathematics is. The article uses the *numeric* referncing style.

* Tao, T. (2007) 'What is good mathematics?', *Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society*, 44(4), pp. 623 - 634. Available at: [https://doi.org/10.1090/S0273-0979-07-01168-8](https://doi.org/10.1090/S0273-0979-07-01168-8)

In this article Ling Qian (2006) writes about fluid flow with moving bodies, and uses an *author-date* style of referencing. 

* Qian, L. (2006) 'A free-surface capturing method for two fluid flows with moving bodies', *Proceedings of the Royal Society A*, 462, pp. 21 - 42, Available at: [https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.2005.1528](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.2005.1528)

## The Harvard Referencing style

* You are required to use the author-date Harvard reference style, specifically the style outlined in *Cite Them Right Harvard* (see link below)
* Pay careful attention to the specific details re ordering, punctuation, use of italics etc and apply consistently.
* Thankfully, the $\LaTeX$ project report template we have provided (see Moodle area) already has the author-date Harvard style implemented. 

### Further help

* [Referencing and why it matters](https://www.mmu.ac.uk/library/referencing-and-study-support/referencing) on the Library website. Includes a link to the full *Cite them Right Harvard* referencing style. 
* [LaTeX and BibTeX](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Bibliography_Management) -- managing citations and references when writing with $\LaTeX$.
* [Endnote](https://www.mmu.ac.uk/library/referencing-and-study-support/endnote) -- software for managing citations and reference lists which integrates with Microsoft Word and other software -- link to MMU library help. 

## Exporting BibTeX entries

* Many publication databases and catalogues will allow you to export references in a suitable format for various software systems, including BibTeX. 
* Unfortunately the MMU library catalogue doesn't seem to provide this at the moment, but other sources do. 
* Let's see an example using the Web of Science database, found on the [Mathematics Subject Guide](https://www.mmu.ac.uk/library/search-tools/subject-guides/mathematics).
