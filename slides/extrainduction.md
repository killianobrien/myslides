## Bury Arcade Trip

To make your return really special, we’re organising a field trip to the [Bury Arcade Club](https://www.arcadeclub.co.uk/bury/) on Friday of Welcome Week (27th September 2024). This is a **free trip** and is open to all final year students in the Department of Computing and Mathematics.

If you would like to come along, please can we ask you to sign-up via the [this form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=UPs_KAujjEiQ9M2uT3rm0Vm1UDwgYT1Np3HapUj9AF9UNzBFSTc2WFJMRUNROE1XOEpRVE4zRFNWUS4u)

On Friday the coach leaves the University at 12:00 noon. We’ll then drive to the Arcade Club, have approximately four hours to spend there, and then we’ll offer a return journey via coach. You are also welcome to make your own way there and meet us at the venue, but please still register at the form above.

If you have any questions about the trip, please reach out to the organiser, Anthony McCormick (a.mccormick@mmu.ac.uk).
