## The visits

All students and their managers had a visit from the placements team in term 1.

A visit from an academic will take place in term 2 (Block 4).

* 30 mins - 1 hr
* Ideally contains time with student, manager, student + manager.
* Short online form to report back findings.

The purposes of the visit by the academic include to:

* meet the student and his or her supervisor to evaluate the experience,
* remind the student about option choice selection, and final year project details,
* remind the student of the deadlines for assessment work (placement report),
* discuss any matters relating to their academic work,
* discuss and review the tasks and responsibilities undertaken to date.

The visit can also allow us to

* discuss other placements or shorter term internships with the company,
* explore other potential collaborations with the department,
* gain exposure to and network with contacts in industry.
