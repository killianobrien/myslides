## Careers, employability and placements

It's never too early to be thinking about life after you graduate. The university has a range of resources to help students prepare for their future. See the main [Careers](https://www.mmu.ac.uk/careers/students){target="_blank"} part of the university website for further information.

[MyCareerHub](https://mycareerhub.mmu.ac.uk/students/jobs){target="_blank"} is the place to go for graduate, placement and internship vacancies and employment related events taking place in or near the university or online. 

### An important upcoming event

* [Graduate Jobs and Placement Fair Wed 5th November 2025](https://mycareerhub.mmu.ac.uk/students/events/detail/3845623){target="_blank"}

A placement is where a student works with an employer for the year between the second and third years of their degree.

* [Placements](https://www.mmu.ac.uk/careers/students/jobs-and-work-experience/placements){target="_blank"} section of the Careers website. 
* [*Get Placed*](https://www.mmu.ac.uk/careers/students/get-placed){target="_blank"} - focused events in semester one to help you succeed in your placement search and application.

## Degree Classifications

Degrees at Man Met are classified as first, 2.1, 2.2, etc using two methods. Both these methods are described in detail in the 

* [Undergraduate Assessment Regulations](https://www.mmu.ac.uk/legal/policies/undergraduate-assessment-regulations-25-26){target="_blank"}

I won't duplicate, and thereby possibly confuse, the details here. You should use the regulations to acquaint yourself with the system so you know exactly where you stand.

* Conditions for *progression*, i.e. continuing to your next level of your course, are also specified in the 
regulations, and summarized on the [university's website here](https://www.mmu.ac.uk/student-life/course/assessments){target="_blank"}

## Student Academic support and pastoral

Primary academic support for your studies comes from the unit teams and your personal tutor. Do make full use of 

* Lectures, tutorials and labs.
* The online resources provided through Moodle.
* Drop-in and bookable consultations (*office hours*) provided by staff. 
* Following the directed self-study parts of the unit, typically tutorial exercises etc. 

The university also provides a range of general academic support and study skills development opportunities.

* [Study skills](https://www.mmu.ac.uk/studyskills){target="_blank"}

There is also help and support available for your wellbeing and mental health while at university.

* [Student Wellbeing](https://www.mmu.ac.uk/student-life/wellbeing/){target="_blank"}

## Personal Learning Plans

*A Personal Learning Plan (PLP) is a document that outlines the support or 'reasonable adjustments' that the University will put in place for you to support your study due to your disability-related needs. It also includes a list of your responsibilities.*

* The reasonable adjustments often involve the ability to request extensions to the deadlines for coursework and/or extensions to the time allowed for examinations.
* But a range of other adjustments are possible to your learning and assessment arrangements depending on your situation.
* PLPs are shared with the academics teaching and assessing you.
* If you already have a PLP, familiarise yourself with its contents and ensure it is updated if need be.
* If you think you may need a PLP then see the information from the [Disability Support Service](https://www.mmu.ac.uk/student-life/wellbeing/disability/){target="_blank"} and speak to them. 

## Academic engagement

Success will come from **good engagement with your course** and you **making the most of the opportunities** that studying at Man Met provides. 

We want you to succeed and will support you in doing so. 

We do monitor student engagement and take action when we feel it is necessary.

* If you are contacted by the university about your engagement
    - please respond promptly and act on their advice,
    - don't ignore the problem hoping it will *go away*.
* If your engagement remains poor and you do not respond to our contacts and advice then the university can begin withdrawal proceedings. 

But this is all *last resort* stuff. 

## On a more positive note

We all know the route to success and enjoyment of your course. It's not a mystery.

* Make sure you attend all your timetabled classes.
* Talk to and work with the other students on your course.
* Put energy into developing and maintaining friendships.
* Carry out the work required for your units. 
* Prepare for, and start work on, courseworks and exams at the earliest opportunity.
* Find good ways to relax and unwind.
* Make the most of being in **Manchester**.



## Academic (mis)conduct

* The University has a thorough well-developed policy on Academic Misconduct which the Mathematics programme fully supports. 
* More information available from [Academic Misconduct](https://www.mmu.ac.uk/student-life/course/assessments/academic-integrity){target="_blank"} site.
* You should maintain the highest standards of behaviour in all aspects of your academic work.



## Mathematical software, lab computers and the Library

* A range of mathematical and scientific software is available from the PCs in the Dalton building and the specialist PCs in the library.
* Dalton building features new labs and student spaces. 
* See [Software download centre](https://www.mmu.ac.uk/about-us/professional-services/itd/software/) for a range of software available for students to install on their own machines - **Matlab** and **Python** in particular.
* I recommend having a local installation of [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) as well as using online tools like [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).
* [University Library](https://www.mmu.ac.uk/library)
