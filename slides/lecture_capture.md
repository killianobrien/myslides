## Introduction to Killian

* Dr Killian O'Brien <img src="./images/mee.jpg" alt="photo of Killian" style="vertical-align:middle;padding:3px;width:300px;float:right;"> 
* Senior Lecturer in Mathematics
    - also teach Applied Cryptography on BSc Cyber Security, supervise MSc projects etc
* <a href="mailto:k.m.obrien@mmu.ac.uk">k.m.obrien@mmu.ac.uk</a>, 3.28 Dalton Building
* at Man Met since 2008

## Lecture capture in Man Met

* Staff guidance on info <a href="https://mmuintranet.mmu.ac.uk/page/10197" target="_blank">on the intranet</a>. 
* The *in-room* capture tech is only in <a href="https://mmuintranet.mmu.ac.uk/page/10197#Lecture-Capture-enab-2" target="_blank">certain rooms</a>, the "lecture theaters".
    - but I often want to capture material from my non-lecture classes: tutorials, seminars,lab sessions, ...
    - smaller groups mean sometimes there are lectures in non-enabled rooms.
    - so coverage is not universal

## The captures from the in room tech

* An example of mine from a few years ago with the in-room tech <iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0owMNLzKcP0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" style="float:right;" allowfullscreen></iframe>
* Some issues
    - the in-room microphone does not produce very *comfortably listenable* audio, and picks up lots of coughs, murmuring, chatting etc from the audience.
    - Potentially obscuring water-mark in the lower right corner.
    - Switching between the presentation and blackboard elements can be tricky.
    - Remember: this is only available in certain rooms.

## Show and tell on my approach

My preferred approach now is to *side step* the in-room tech and instead ...

* Capture my lecture with my laptop. <iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zruc4vfwc5I?si=sHnftFmxqKecW8dK&amp;start=2408" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" style="float:right;" allowfullscreen></iframe>
* Everything is going through the laptop
    - presentation slides
    - PDF lecture notes etc
    - software demos
    - the "blackboard" with a graphics tablet
    - using a clip-on (wired or BT) microphone for much better audio
    - a webcam view of me (for vanity? crucial hand-waving explanations?)
* Then simply capture the laptop screen + mic input with OBS or similar software. 
* Use of personal laptop allows me to use my preferred software combination
    - quick, easy workflow
    - can dismiss all distracting UI elements for a larger clean canvas

Then after class, quickly upload to MMUtube and insert link/embed in Moodle.
